													<h3>Library Management System</h3>
													<div class="box">
													<p><h3>Introduction : </h3>
														The Book Nook is a library management system that aims to automate and simplify the process of book and video item management in a library. The project is developed with the aim of providing a user-friendly interface for library staff and users, and it is designed to handle all aspects of library management, including book and video item management, user registration, borrowing and returning of items, and penalties for late returns.
														</p>
														<p><h3>Analysis:</h3> 
															Overall, the Book Nook system provides a basic solution for managing inventory and borrowing items in a library or classroom setting. While it may have some limitations in terms of scalability, security, and functionality, it can be a useful tool for small to medium-sized organizations that want to automate their inventory management and borrowing processes.
													        The object-oriented design of the system, with its clear class hierarchy and well-defined methods and attributes, makes it easy to understand and modify.

												<h3>MUSIC HUB (recommending songs based on user behaviour)</h3>
												<div class="box">
													<p><h4>Introduction:</h4>
														The project, titled "MusicHub," is a console-based music application that allows users to manage playlists, explore song recommendations, and interact with their profiles as well. The application incorporates features such as playlist management, user authentication, and song recommendation based on user behavior.<p>
														</p>

												<h3>STUDENT DATA BANK</h3>
												<div class="box">
													<p><h4>Introduction:</h4>
														The Assembly Language Student Data bank is a software solution designed for efficiently managing student data within an educational institution. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for administrators to insert, search, modify, and delete student records with access to authorized personnel only. The system ensures ease of maintenance and scalability for future requirements.</p>
												    <p><h4>Project Implementation:</h4>
														The project is implemented in Assembly Language, using the Irvine32.inc  library and Macros.inc library for file operations and user interaction. The code is modular, with separate procedures for login, menu navigation, record insertion, search, modification, deletion, and program termination.

													<h3>RESTAURANT SIMULATION (Multithreading and task parallelism)</h3>
													<div class="box">
														<p><h4>Methodology:</h4>
															This project employs multithreading and synchronization techniques in C to simulate a restaurant's kitchen management system. The main function initializes menu items, displays the menu, and creates producer and consumer threads for order processing. The ProducerCode function reads orders from "Orders.txt" into a circular buffer, while the ConsumerCode function consumes orders from the buffer.
															</p>
															<p><h4>Features Utilized:</h4>
																<p> Menu items are retrieved from "Menu.txt".</p>
																 Orders are sourced from "Orders.txt" and stored in the order_buffer for dynamic processing.
																 Inventory levels dynamically adjust based on components used in orders, managed in Low_High_Inventory.
																 Kitchen components (fryers, boilers, ovens) are simulated using semaphores (friersem, boilersem, ovensem) for access control.
																 Mutex locks (pthread_mutex_t) ensure exclusive access to shared resources like the inventory file.
																 Condition variables (pthread_cond_t) are used for signaling between producer and consumer threads for orderly processing.
																</p>
